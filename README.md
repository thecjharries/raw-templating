## Overview

I really, really want to start working with [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) again. I sat down to draft one up, got intimidated by the amount of braces I'd have to start throwing around again, and, somehow, thought throwing together a bunch of `bash` would be easier.

It wasn't.

Eventually I might have other things in here but for now you're probably interested in [the shell solution](./shell-solution).
